# Version 0.4.0.0 (Unknown)

  * Add the `resolve` function.  If you have a playlist that contains
    references to remote playlists, this new function will recursively
    download and process playlists until it has a flat playlist with
    no further remote references.

# Version 0.3.0.0 (January 24, 2015)

  * Update dependencies to recent versions (thanks to Wieland Hoffmann).
